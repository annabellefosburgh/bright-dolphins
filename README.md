# Work Day Scheduler

## Application

This is a simple calendar application that allows you to save a task to an hourly slot. The hourly time blocks will also tell you whether your task is current, in the past, or in a future hour. 

## Usage
This application is built so you can type in a task for a specific time period and keep track of when you have tasks to complete.

## The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
